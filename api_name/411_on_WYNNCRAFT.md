- Not necessary to get a key to make requests
- Hassle to get a key- you'll need to show a significant project you'll work on with said key

- For V2:
  - 600/30min ingredients

## The Good:
- has all the information you'd need for an application that involves the game
## The Bad:
- why would you be interested in using this without being invested in the game
## The Ugly:
- The item section has some major issues that haven't been fixed for years, and devs just work around them. Historically has had critical typos and even just wrong info.
- Strict rate limits mean that getting an api key is essential, but lack of clarification regarding rate limits with/without.
- Honestly 0 reason to not request once and just store the data locally for item/ing related projects
