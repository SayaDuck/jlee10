- Flexbox really saved us here, along with using % to make sure that each box was scaling properly (and staying on the same line)
- lack of </p> makes us unable to style the copyright section... I don't know if that was intended? If we could close it then it would be super simple (set it up in body style and override it for everything else)
- There probably is a way to do it while only closing the <p> by abusing element positions right?

- MODIFYING IT IS TREASON!!! GET THOSE <t>s and <div>s OUTTA HERE!!!
